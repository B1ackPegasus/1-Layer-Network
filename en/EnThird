In a world-first, scientists had a "conversation" with a whale.Now, researchers are trying to find out what they are actually saying.A growling "throp" noise emanates from the research vessel's underwater speaker.A humpback breaks away from its group and approaches. The mammal circles the boat.It surfaces and then dives again, tail slipping noiselessly into the water, and echoes the call back.It could be the first step towards communication with non-human intelligence.
