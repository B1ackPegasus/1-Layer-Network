The CMA said that a small number of incumbent technology firms - already powerful in the most important
digital markets - were also now taking the lead with foundation models.
Trained on vast amounts of data, they underpin tools which are transforming workplaces and other aspects of modern life.
The big tech firms have strong positions in terms of computing power, and access skilled employees, the CMA said,
and can influence access to the market through apps and platforms.
This could profoundly impact fair competition "ultimately harming businesses and consumers,
for example through reduced choice, lower quality, and higher prices, as well as stunting the flow of potentially
unprecedented innovation and wider economic benefits from AI", the CMA argued.
