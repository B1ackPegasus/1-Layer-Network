At the ski resort of Ruka, Finland, the snow normally starts to melt in April.
In early May, the 22 chairlifts will, temporarily, grind to a halt.
The 41 trails will, like every year, turn green â€“ making the hill a destination for hikers and mountain bikers, not skiers.
Five of the trails have been punctuated by two mounds of snow covered in white polystyrene blankets.
Each huge mound will hold about 30,000 cubic metres (1.05 million cubic ft) of snow.
They will stay there throughout the summer. When these mounds are uncovered in October,
according to data estimates based on past years, some 80 to 90% of the snow will remain,
enough to spread across three or four downhill slopes, plus the snow park.
