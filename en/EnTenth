The tech behind a flying car, originally developed and successfully test-flown in Europe, has been bought by a Chinese firm.
Powered by a BMW engine and normal fuel, the AirCar flew for 35 minutes between two Slovakian airports in 2021, using runways for take-off and landing.
It took just over two minutes to transform from a car into an aircraft.
Now vehicles made based on its design will be used within a "specific geographical region" of China.
Hebei Jianxin Flying Car Technology Company, headquartered in Cangzhou, has purchased exclusive rights to manufacture and use AirCar aircraft inside an undisclosed area.
The firm has built its own airport and flight school after a previous acquisition from another Slovak aircraft manufacturer,
said Anton Zajac, cofounder of KleinVision, the company which created AirCar.
