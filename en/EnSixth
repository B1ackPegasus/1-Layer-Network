A non-league football club has received an injection of $4.5m (about Â£3.6m) from a pair of cryptocurrency investors.
Real Bedford FC (RBFC) received the Bitcoin investment from Winklevoss Capital, an investment firm owned by Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.
Podcaster Peter McCormack bought the side, currently in the ninth tier of English football, in 2021 with the goal of turning it into a Premier League club.
Following the investment the twins will assume the role of co-owners of the club alongside the cryptocurrency podcaster.
The Winklevoss brothers are pretty familiar with controversy.
They famously accused Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg of stealing the idea for his site from them when they were all at Harvard together.
