But in doing so they have run up against two bigger mysteries including one that casts doubt on where our heavy elements  like gold  come from
The burst of light spotted in 2022 is now known to have had an exploding star at its heart researchers say
But that explosion by itself would not have been sufficient to have shone so brightly
And our current theory says that some exploding stars known as supernovas might also produce the heavy elements in the universe such as gold and platinum
But the team found none of these elements raising new questions about how precious metals are produced
Prof Catherine Heymans of Edinburgh University and Scotlands Astronomer Royal who is independent of the research team said that results like these help to drive science forward
