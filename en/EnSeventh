The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is looking into the new breed of powerful AI tools - foundation models.
They include text and image generators, such as ChatGPT.
The CMA found an "interconnected web" of AI partnerships involving the same firms: Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and chip-maker Nvidia.
"When we started this work, we were curious. Now, with a deeper understanding and having watched developments very closely,
we have real concerns," Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA said.
"The essential challenge we face is how to harness this immensely exciting technology for the benefit of all,
while safeguarding against potential exploitation of market power and unintended consequences."
