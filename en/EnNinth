X, formerly Twitter, is giving blue ticks to its most "influential" users in a significant change of policy.
Those with more than 2,500 verified followers - people already paying for X Premium - have been given premium features for free.
As well as the blue tick, the users will see fewer adverts on X.
Blue ticks were originally a way to verify users were who they claimed to be, but they became a paid-for feature after Elon Musk purchased the site.
However, according to messages received by people who have been given the features,
it is now being given out without cost if a person is an "influential member of the community".
Premium users also see their tweets ranked higher when replying to others,
and it enables them to apply for revenue sharing from adverts on the site.
