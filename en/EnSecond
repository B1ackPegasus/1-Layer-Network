Taylor Swift's songs are back on TikTok following a dispute that led her label to stop licensing its content to the app.
Her music's return on Thursday comes ahead of the release of her new album, The Tortured Poets Department.
Universal Music pulled songs by its artists in January, including Rihanna and Ariana Grande, citing a licensing dispute.
Many artists have complained about inadequate royalties from TikTok.
While many of her songs - including You Belong With Me and Cruel Summer - are again available for users to add to their videos,music belonging to Universal's other artists has still not been relisted.
Some reports speculated Swift reached a separate deal with TikTok.
